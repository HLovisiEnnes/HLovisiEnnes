Hi!

My name is Henrique and I hail from Minas Gerais, Brazil. I majored in Mathematics and Physics at Whitman College (Walla Walla, WA) and had my Master's in Mathematical Modeling from FGV-EMAp (Rio de Janeiro). Right now I am a Ph.D. student, advised by Clément Maria (https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Clement.Maria/) and Nicolas Nisse (https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nicolas.Nisse/), at INRIA/Université Côte d'Azur in Valbonne, southern France, where I research Quantum Topology. More specifically, I am interested in investigating the frontier between classical and quantum algorithms by looking at problems in low-dimension topology. I also intensely love statistics and machine learning, both theoretical and applied, so you can find me tackling some problems in these fields now and then! 

When not in front of my laptop, I am a huge fan of History, Arts, JRPGs, and music from Minas.
