Since I was pretty young, I knew that I wanted to be some sort of scientist. I have always been very curious about the world and, specially, on how we, humans, see it. Because of such an inclination, my dream professions ranged throughout the years from historian to neuroscientist. Nonetheless, it was only as a Physics and, a little later, Mathematics major that I have discovered the power of numbers in doing exactly what I so much desired for. After some time working in mathematical physics as an undergraduate at Whitman College, I have found in data science, and, more specifically, in topological data analysis, the ability to start understanding the processes which allow for both humans and computers to learn. 

Currently, I am a Master’s degree pursuer at Fundação Getúlio Vargas Mathematical Department, in Rio, working with some theoretical foundations behind manifold and topological learning, with special interest in developing methods that emulate the ways we, humans, think at a computational level – basically, I want to understand how thinking happens through differential geometry! Additionally, I have currently been having some fun with applied work in data science and statistics, especially in natural language processing of legal documents and description of extreme climate events. 

When not in front of my laptop, I am a huge fan of History, Arts, JRPGs and music!
